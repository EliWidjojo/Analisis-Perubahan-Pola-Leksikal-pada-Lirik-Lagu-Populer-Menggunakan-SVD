Awoo!
Who's that I see walkin' in these woods?
Why, it's Little Red Riding Hood!
Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me!
Little Red Riding Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone
Awoo!
What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So, just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought to walk with you for a ways
What full lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So, until you get to Grandma's place
I think you ought to walk with me and be safe
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone
Awoo!
Little Red Riding Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't
Awoo!
What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Riding Hood
Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to be satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to Grandma's place
Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything that a big bad wolf could want
Awoo!
I mean baa
Baa?
Baa
