As I walk this land of broken dreams (Broken dreams)
I have visions of many things (So many things)
But happiness is just an illusion (Just an illusion)
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
Maybe
The roots of love grow all around (All around)
But for me they come a tumblin' down (Come tumblin' down)
Every day, heartaches grow a little stronger (Just a little stronger)
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light (Searching for light)
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight (No comfort in sight)
Hoping and praying for someone who cares (Who really cares)
Always moving and going nowhere
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
Help me
I'm searching though I don't succeed (Don't succeed)
For someone's love, there's a growing need (Such a growing need)
All is lost, there's no place for beginning (No beginning)
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday, I know I'm gonna find a way (What becomes of the brokenhearted)
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'll find a way somehow, and (Who had love that's now departed)
I'll be searching everywhere, I know I'm gonna find a way
I'll be lookin' (Who had love that's now departed)
