When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love? (Groovy kind of love)
We've got a groovy kind of love (Groovy kind of love)
Anytime you want to, you can turn me on to
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I taste your lips, oh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love? (Groovy kind of love)
We've got a groovy kind of love
When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
If the world would shatter, I don't care
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love? (Groovy kind of love)
We've got a groovy kind of love (Groovy kind of love)
We've got a groovy kind of love
