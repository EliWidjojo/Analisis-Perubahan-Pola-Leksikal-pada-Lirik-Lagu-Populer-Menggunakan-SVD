You keep sayin' you got something for me
Somethin' you call love, but confess
You've been-a-messin' where you shouldn't-a-been-messing
And now someone else is getting all your best
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
Yeah
You keep lyin' when you ought to be truthin'
You keep losin' when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a-changin'
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt, ha
I've just found me a brand-new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows, you ain't had time to learn
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'
