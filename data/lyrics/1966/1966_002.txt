Too many teardrops
For one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughin'
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get there
We'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you
Way down here
And you'll start cryin'
Ninety-six tears
Cry
Cry
And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
You'll be right down there lookin' up
And I might wave, come up here
But I don't see you wavin' now
I'm way down here wonderin' how
I'm gonna get you, but I know now
I'll just cry
Cry
I'll just cry
Too many teardrops
For one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry, now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears, c'mon, let me hear you cry, now
Ninety-six tears, woo, I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long
Ninety-six tears, cry, cry, cry
C'mon baby, let me hear you cry now
All night long, ninety-six tears
Yeah, c'mon now, ninety-six tears
