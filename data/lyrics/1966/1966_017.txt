Listen to me, baby, you gotta understand
You're old enough to know the makings of a man
Listen to me, baby, it's hard to settle down
Am I asking too much for you to stick around?
Every boy wants a girl
He can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you
Won't you wait but 'til then?
When I see lips
Begging to be kissed (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)
Lightning striking again
Lightning striking again
Nature's taking over my one-track mind
Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time
All the girls are sayin' that you'll end up a fool
For the time being, baby, live by my rule
When I settle down
I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget
And I'll make up for all lost time
If she's put together fine
And she's readin' my mind (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)
Lightning striking again
Lightning striking again
And again and again and again
Lightning striking again
Lightning striking again
There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture in your mind
Love forever, but 'til then
If she give me a sign
That she wants to make time (Stop)
I can't stop (Stop)
I can't stop myself (Stop, stop)
Lightning striking again
Ah, lightning striking again
And again and again and again and again
Lightning striking again
