On
I realise the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And you don't get for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me
You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (Carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinkin' aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
And eager to be what you wanted
So lift your eyes if you feel you can (Feel you can)
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan (Show you a plan)
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me (Oh, oh)
You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long (I've been love too long)
It started so easy
You want to carry on (Carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinkin' aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
And eager to be what you wanted
You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long (I've been here too long)
It started so easy
You want to carry on (Carry on, carry on, carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinkin' aloud, fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
Eager to be what you wanted
Now I'm lost (Lost in love and I don't know much)
Lost in love (Was I thinkin' aloud, you out of touch?)
Lost in love (But I'm back on my feet)
Lost in love (And eager to be what you wanted)
Now I'm lost (Lost in love and I don't know much)
I'm in love (Was I thinkin' aloud, you out of touch?)
I'm lost in love (But I'm back on my feet)
Lost in love (And eager to be what you wanted)
