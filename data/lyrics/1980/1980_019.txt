I love you
Yeah
Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
So please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay
If you leave, at least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you
So please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay, hey, hey, hey
Yeah
Babe, I love you so
I, I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
So please don't go, don't go
Don't go away, hey, hey, hey
I need your love, I'm down on my knees
Begging, "Please, please, please, don't go"
Don't you hear me, baby? Don't leave me now
Oh, no, no, don't go
Please don't go, I want you to know
That I, I, I love you so
Please don't leave me, baby
Please don't go
