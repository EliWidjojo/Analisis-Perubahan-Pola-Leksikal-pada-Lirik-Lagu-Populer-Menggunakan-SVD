It's a summertime affair
Shaggy, ha
Ravyon
Sun and fun in the atmosphere, oh, yes
In the summertime, when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women, you've got women on your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even though the speed limit's twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie
Weh me say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair in the atmosphere
I man love off her attire and the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tire and a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up, not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my Christas, so the girls them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon as your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career, so tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new selection for your musical ear
'Cause we say what we want and we say what we need
And we love everybody, and we do as we please
And when the weather is fine
We go fishin', we go fishin' in the sea
We are happy
To live life, that's our philosophy
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, just do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even ehough the speed limit's twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie
Sweat a-run off her body with her caramel skin
I man smiled at her, she looked at me and gave me a grin
I offered her a drink, and she said juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear, I asked, "How you doin'?"
Where was it that I reside, and I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance, eyes were sparkling
Just her voice and what she said, "Let my poor head spin"
Raggamuffin Shaggy now with a musical swing
I say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
In the summertime, when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women, you've got women on your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even though the speed limit is twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie
Pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
I said pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair in the atmosphere
I man love off her attire and the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tire and a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up, not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my Christas, so the girls them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon as your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career, so tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new selection for your musical ear
In the summertime (In the summertime)
In the summertime (In the summertime)
Sweet summertime
I said, pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
