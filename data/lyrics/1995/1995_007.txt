Oh, when you walk by every night
Talkin' sweet and lookin' fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mm, baby, I'm so into you
Darlin', if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so badly)
Sha-do-do-do-do

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughin' boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
