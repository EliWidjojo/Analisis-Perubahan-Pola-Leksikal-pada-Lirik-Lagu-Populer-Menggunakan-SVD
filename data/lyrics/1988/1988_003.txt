I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
Got my mind set on you
But it's gonna take-a money
A whole lotta' spending money
It's going to take plenty-a money
To do it right, chile
It's gonna take time
Whole lotta' precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right, chile
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
And this time I know it's for real
The feeling that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it
I got my mind set on you
Set on you
I got my mind set on you
Set on you
But it's gonna take-a money
Whole lotta' spending money
It's gonna take plenty-a money
To do it right, chile
It's gonna take time
Whole lotta' precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right!
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
And this time I know it's for real

I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it
But it's gonna to take-a money
A whole lotta' spending money
It's gonna take plenty-a money
To do it right, chile
It's gonna take-a time
A whole lotta' precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
