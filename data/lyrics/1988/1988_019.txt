Step inside
Walk this way
You and me, babe
Hey hey!
Hey
Hey
Hey
Love is like a bomb, baby, come on, get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man? (Your man)
Hey
Hey
Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah
Yeah
Come on
Take a bottle
Shake it up
Break the bubble
Break it up
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah
Listen!
Red light, yellow light, green-a-light go!
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of the love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up (Loosen up)
Loosen up
You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little, tease a little more
Easy operator come a-knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me (Yeah)
Yeah
Give a little more
Take a bottle
Shake it up
Break the bubble
Break it up
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah
You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
'Cause I'm hot, so hot (Hot)
Sticky sweet
From my head (Head)
My head, to my feet (Head)
Do you take sugar?
One lump or two?
Take a bottle (Take a bottle)
Shake it up (Shake it up)
Break the bubble (Break it up)
Break it up
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Get it, come get it
Pour your sugar on me (Ooh)
Pour some sugar on me (Yeah)
Sugar me!
