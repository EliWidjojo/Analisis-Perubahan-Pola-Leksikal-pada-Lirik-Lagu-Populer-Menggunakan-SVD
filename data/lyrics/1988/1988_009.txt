As I watch you move
Across the moon-lit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow, I must leave
The dawn knows no reprieve
God, give me strength when I am leaving
So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
As we move to embrace
Tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain
It's driving me insane
Without your touch
Life will be lonely
So raise your hands to heaven and pray (And pray)
That we'll be back together someday
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
Morning has come, another day
I must pack my bags and say
Goodbye, goodbye
Tonight, I need your sweet caress (Oh whoa)
Hold me in the darkness (Darkness)
Tonight, you calm my restlessness (Oh whoa)
You relieve my sadness (Sadness)
Tonight, I need your sweet caress (Oh whoa)
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness (You calm my restlessness)
You relieve my sadness
No, no, whoa
Oh, oh, oh whoa
