Mattie told Hattie
About a thing she saw
Had two big horns
And a wooly jaw
Wooly Bully!
Wooly Bully (Yeah, drive!)
Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully
Hattie told Mattie, 
"Let's don't take no chance
Let's not be L-7 
Come and learn to dance"
Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully
Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully
(Watch it now, watch it, watch it, watch!)
Ahhhh! Hey!
Hey! Drive, drive, drive!
Mattie told Hattie 
"It's the thing to do
Get you someone really
Pull the wool with you"
Wooly Bully!
Wooly Bully
Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully, Wooly Bully
(Watch it now, watch it, here it come!)
You got it, you got it!
