Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots, that's black to match
Riding on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I've been in the valley, you ain't been up off that porch now
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothang
You can't tell me nothing
I like me a bitch out the gutter (Uh-huh)
I like me a bitch that can hustle (Uh-huh)
I light up her wrist, had to bust her
She wanna pop a G6 wit me (Go)
Then I bought her a G63 (Skrrrt)
Then I had gave her the recipe (Woo)
Look at her, now she the best of me (Best)
Wondering why she obsessed with me (Sexy)
You niggas don't get as fresh as me (Nah)
Bought her the Tiffany, Patek Phillipe (Go)
Just like a baby, I rock her to sleep
Take the bitch to France, make her diamonds dance
She done seen the Lamb', taking off her pants
This a hundred bands, no, it's not a scam
This is Marni Bucket, and, it was made of lamb (Marni)
No, I wasn't lucky, I was in the jam
Man, I came from nothing, I was serving pounds
I've been getting money, I can run the Town
Baby girl, you lucky, I can spend it now (Whoo)
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothang
You can't tell me nothing
Riding on a tractor, lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby, you can go and ask her
My life is a movie, bull riding and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci, wrangler around my booty
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
Maserati rowdy, got a V12 for my bride (Skrrt)
Foggy rocky road, got a three-wheeler inside (Ayy)
All I wanna do is take a pill, catch a chill vibe
Real prince, I'm really the real don
(I'ma take) I'ma take a horse to the South Berry Road (Ayy)
I don't remember her name, but I painted on her nose (Ayy)
Country money, I don't gotta do no chores
I'm a menace, I got women tryna sneak me through their doors (Skrrt)
[Chorus: Young Thug & 
Lil Nas X
]
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me, you can't tell me
(Brrrrrrt)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Who?)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Bitch!)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Us)
Bet not drop that PIN (Drop it, drop it)
We gone spin again
I'ma spin (Spin, spin)
We gone slide (Slide)
Drop that PIN, pussy nigga, come outside (Come outside)
I been running out that chicken, I ain't tired (Dough)
Ain't shed another tear since when my grandma died (Grandma, Grandma)
I got all white rose with the bloody guts inside (Yup)
Think shit sweet then try it, step in the shoes, they not yo size (Niggas ain't stepping)
The back of the Maybach, I sit in recline (Think about what)
And I got Franklins all on my mind then chrome the spin (What else)
Chrome the 9 (Then what)
Bullet proof the ride (Skrrrrrrrrt!)
We spin the block and yell our "He ain't outside!" (Where he at)
Heard we had a wedding, he must be the bride (Shit)
I take them pies, subtract them & divide (Take on!)
Fuck the other shit, I'm going for the win (Fucking win)
Pulled up with that bitch then pulled up with his friends (Skrrrt)
[Bridge: Mason Ramsey

Hold up, let me tell y'all something
You can't tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Hop up in my RZR, got a thousand acres
Ride up on the cows with it, pray that it don't faze her
Aye-o, aye-o, yippee-o ki-yay
If you ain't got no giddy up, then giddy out my way
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
Yeehaw
