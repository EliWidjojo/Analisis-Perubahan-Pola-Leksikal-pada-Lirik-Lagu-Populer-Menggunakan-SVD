I'm at a fish I don't wanna be in
I'm not prepared and I have no clothes
I can face my back
Ask yourself if it's possible to buy a seat
Where is my hand?
I said to myself, "Do you dance?" (Satan)
Do you know that I love myself?
Is everything in life real?
Holiday does not match with confidence
Each has many words, yes
I have a lot of shape and everything, mm
We want one with fox
(What does the fox say?)
I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
We do not want to be dinner
Terry, I do not know
I want to read my ears
This place exists
It is the disease of tension
But what I say is done
Education? Eh, it's nice for me to think about it
Find out the good things
No human contact
Yes, everyone is right, yes
I'm very happy with the animals
And you can heal him
I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
Yes, yes, yes, no
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
Beyond the Gulf of Persia
But who does not love me?
Every single Jesus
But who does not love me?
Dear, this is my own business
I do not like you, you are so beautiful
God, everything
But who does not love me?
Ayyyy
I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
