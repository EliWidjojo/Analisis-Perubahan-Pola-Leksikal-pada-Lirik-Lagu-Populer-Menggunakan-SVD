Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you, I love you
You shared my dreams, my joys, my pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again, dear
I'd spend each and every moment with you
You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you, I love you
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Woo, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, woo, ooh, ooh)
(Woo, ooh, ooh, woo, ooh, ooh)
You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you, I love you
