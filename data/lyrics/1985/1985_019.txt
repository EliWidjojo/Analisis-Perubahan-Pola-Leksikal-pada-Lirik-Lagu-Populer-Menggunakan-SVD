The heat is on
On the street
Inside your head
On every beat
And the beat's so loud
Deep inside
The pressure's high
Just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on
Woo!
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Oh, it's on the street
The heat is on
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
The heat is on (Yeah!)
The heat is on (Oh, yeah)
The heat is on (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
It's on the street (Woo hoo)
The heat is on
The shadow's high
On the darker side
Behind the doors
It's a wilder ride
You can make a break
You can win or lose
That's a chance you take
When the heat's on you
And the heat is on
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Oh, ooh-oh-ho
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
The heat is on (Yeah!)
The heat is on (Oh, yeah)
The heat is on (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
It's on the street (Woo hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
It's on the street (Flames are burnin' higher)
The heat is on (Baby, can't you feel it?)
The heat is on (Woo hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)...
