Raindrops are fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet
Are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like
The way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness
Steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me
It won't be long 'til happiness
Steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me
