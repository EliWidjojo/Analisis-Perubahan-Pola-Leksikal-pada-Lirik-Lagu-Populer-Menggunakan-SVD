Never met a girl could make me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Whenever I'm asked what makes my dreams real
I tell 'em you do, you're outta' sight
Well, twiddley dee, twiddley dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come
I'm bringing you a love that's true (get ready)
Get ready, (get ready)

Get ready, (get ready)
Oh, don't you know I'm comin'? (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
On my way (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
You wanna' play hide and seek with love
Let me remind you, you're alright
Lovin' you're gonna' miss
And the time it takes to find you, you're outta' sight
