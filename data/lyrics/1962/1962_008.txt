Let me in, whee-ooh
(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh) Hoop-whee-ooh
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh
Whee-ooh
I can see the dancin' (Let me in)
The silhouettes on the shade (The silhouettes)
I hear the music (Music), all the lovers on parade
Open up (Let me in), I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend
Pitter-patter of the feet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that beat
Jumpin' and stompin' on the floor
(Let me in) Let me in
(Open up) Open up
Why don't you open up that door? (Let me in)
I hear music (Open up that door), let me in (Music)
I want to come in again
Let me in (Let me in), a-well, I heard it just then
I thought you were my friend
(Whee-ooh) Whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh
Whee-ooh
Pitter-patter of the feet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that beat
Jumpin' and stompin' on the floor
(Let me in) Let me in
(Open up) Open up
Why don't you open up that door? (Let me in)
I hear music (Open up that door), let me in (Music)
Oh, I heard it just then
Let me in (Let me in)
I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh
Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh
Hoop-whee-ooh
Hoop-whee-ooh
Hoop-whee-ooh
