Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
When I saw you walkin' down the street
I said that's the kind of gal I'd like to meet
She's so pretty, Lord, she's fine
I'm gonna make her mine all mine
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
Hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey, baby
