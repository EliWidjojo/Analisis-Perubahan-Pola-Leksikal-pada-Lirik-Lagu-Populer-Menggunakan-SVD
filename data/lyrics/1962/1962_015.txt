Breaking up is hard to do
Don't take your love away from me!
Don't you leave my heart in misery?
If you go, then I'll be blue!
'Cuz breaking up is hard to do
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now, I know, I know that it's true!
Don't say that this is the end!
Instead of breaking up, I wish we were making up again
I beg of you, don't say goodbye!
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on, baby, let's start a new!
