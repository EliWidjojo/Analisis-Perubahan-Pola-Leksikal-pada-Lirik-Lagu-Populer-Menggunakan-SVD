Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie
The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches in, to where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road
My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light
When I was young I thought of growin' old
Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be?
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel (Kyrie, will you follow?)
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night (Yeah)
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow? (Will you follow?)
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light (Yeah)
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow? (Will you follow?)
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel (Will you follow?)
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie elei—
