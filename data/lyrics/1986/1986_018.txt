Ooh-hoo, oh, yeah, yeah
Whoa-oh-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-oh
Hey, baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things, you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know
We can't go on just runnin' away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down
Never
Never
Never
Never run away
Hey, baby, you know it's true
Why you bother lyin'
When you know that, that you want it, too?
Don't you dare deny me
Now walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, never let me go
We can't go on just runnin' away
If we wait any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down
Never Oh
Never Oh, no
Never
Never run away
Never No, never

Never No, no, no, no
Never run away
Hey, baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things, you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah

One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know
We can't go on just runnin' away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
