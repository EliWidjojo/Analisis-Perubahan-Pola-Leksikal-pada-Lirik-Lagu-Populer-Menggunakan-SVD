Let's stay together
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together (-gether)
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh-ooh, ooh, whoo-ooh-hoo, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Why somebody, why people break up
Oh, turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do
Let's, we ought to stay together (-gether)
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
C'mon, let's, woo, (Let's stay together) let's stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether, oh, times are good or bad
