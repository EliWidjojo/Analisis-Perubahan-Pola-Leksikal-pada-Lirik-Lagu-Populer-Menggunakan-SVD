We've got to do our alma mater, we must do our alma mater
When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Mmm, and then mamma took me to grammar School
But I stopped off in the vestibule
Every time that bell would ring
Catch me playing with my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Ah, that was beautiful
You know what I heard, I heard
I hear two girls over here singing in harmony
That's alright, honey, this is a free country
Live like you wanna live, baby! Yeah
Ain't nobody gonna knock it darling, mm-mmm
Yeah, freedom!
Yes sir, there's one guy right over here singin' "mine" too
That's all right, brother!
Yes sir, you got a right, baby
Ain't nobody gonna bother you, tell you
Once I was climbing the garden wall
I slipped and had a terrible fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But held onto my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Mmm, you know that's future parliament out there singin'?
Oh yeah! (yeah!)
Mmm, once I was swimming 'cross turtle creek
Man, them snappers all around my feet
Sure was hard swimming 'cross that thing
With both hands holing my ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
That's so beautiful
I think it's a beautiful little song, really I do
And guess what, everybody's still not singing
There's a few right down front here that's not singing
We're gonna dedicate this verse
To those who will not sing, yes sir
Mmm, this here song, it ain't so sad
The cutest little song you ever had
Those of you who will not sing
You must be playing with your own ding-a-ling-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Oh, your ding-a-ling, your ding-a-ling
We saw you playing with your ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling, everybody sing
I want to play with my ding, everybody
My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling, slow down
I wanna play, everybody, with my ding-a-ling
