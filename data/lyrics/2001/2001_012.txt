Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
How come you gave the women accеss to your villa?
Trespass and witnessing the hacklin’ of your pillow
You bеtter watch your back before she turn into a killer
You best review the situation that you’re caught up inna
To be a true player you must know how to play
If she say it was in the night, convince her that it’s the day
Never admit to a word that she says
And if she claims it’s you tell her “Baby, no way”
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?
Let her know she really has no reason to be vexed
It’s never you she saw making the gigolo flex
It was someone that resembles you in the complex
Seein’ is believing so you better change your specs
You know she's going to bring up a lot of things up from the past
All the little evidence, you better know to mask
Quick on your answers, know how to talk
But if she packs a gun, you know you better run fast
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
