I ain't sayin' that I always sleep alone
I ain't sayin' that I ain't met no one else
Done a little bit of midnight movin' on
And I ain't sayin' when I do that it don't help
Leave with someone, I don't know her name
Pull her real close, but I leave some space
And I could forget you, girl, for good
Even though I should
I never let my heart go all the way
Every time I try, I just hit the brakes
And there's always a couple tryna take your place
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
You wake up wantin' me out of the blue
You lay down needin' what I used to do
Yeah, every now and then, I go get a taste
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
Just in case
I always take it to the edge, then I back it up
They don't know I got a reason for actin' up
I ain't felt a damn thing, baby, after us
Yeah, I'm just hopin' you'll come back to us
That's wishful thinkin', baby, honestly
But I know you ain't forgotten me
So I never let my heart go all the way
Every time I try, I just hit the brakes
And there's always a couple tryna take your place
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
You wake up wantin' me out of the blue
You lay down needin' what I used to do
Yeah, every now and then, I go get a taste
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
Just in case
Leave with someone, I don't know her name
Pull her real close, but I leave some space
Yeah, I could have three words on my tongue
But I won't ever say 'em
'Cause I never let my heart go all the way
Every time I try, I just hit the brakes
And there's always a couple tryna take your place
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
You wake up wantin' me out of the blue
You lay down needin' what I used to do
Yeah, every now and then, I go get a taste
But I never fall in love, baby, just in case
Just in case
