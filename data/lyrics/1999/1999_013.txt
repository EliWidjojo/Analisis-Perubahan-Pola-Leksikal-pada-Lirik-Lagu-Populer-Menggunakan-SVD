Could you whisper in my ear?
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anything
To feel it comin'
Do you wake up on your own
Or wonder where you are?
And live with all your faults
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?
Yeah, we're gonna let it slide
Don't you love the life you killed?
Priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
Don't suppose I'll ever know
Some means to be a man
Or something I can change
I live around here
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Mm, slide
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?
Ooh-oo, ooh
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything
(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Ohh-ohh, oh May
Yeah, slide between the sheets
Of all them beds you never knew
(Yeah, slide)
Why don't you slide into my room
Just slide into my room
And, oh, we'll run away
Run away, run away
