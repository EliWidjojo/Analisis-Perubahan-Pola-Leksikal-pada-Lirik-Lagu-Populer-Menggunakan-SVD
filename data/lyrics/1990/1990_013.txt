Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that
Awa, a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
Awa, a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Yo, pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead, the crowd a-jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that
Awa, a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
