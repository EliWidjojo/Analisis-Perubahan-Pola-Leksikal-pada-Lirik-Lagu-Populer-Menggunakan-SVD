Yeah, Spyderman and Freeze in full effect
Uh-huh
You ready, Ron?
I'm ready
You ready, Biv?
I'm ready, Slick, are you?
Oh, yeah, break it down
Girl, I, must (Warn you)
I sense something strange in my mind, yeah, yo
Situation is (Serious)
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
It's oh so (Beautiful)
Relationships, they seem from the start, yeah, mhm
It's all so (Deadly)
When love is not together from the heart, mhm, check it out
It's drivin' me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move, you're dead)
That girl is (Poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (Poison)
If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I step to meet a fly girl, you know?
'Cause in some (Portions)
You'll think she's the best thing in the world
She's so (Fly)
She'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware, she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' "demon," ooh
Poison, deadly, movin' in slow
Lookin' for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin' paid, laid, so better lay low
Schemin' on house, money and the whole show
The low pro ho, she'll be cut like an afro
See what you're sayin', huh
She's a winner to you, but I know she's a loser
(How do you know?), me and the crew used to do her
Poison
Poison
Poison
Poison
Poison
I was at the park, shake, breakin', and takin 'em all
And that night, I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open, still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be with a high-power chest
Michael Bivins here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell Biv DeVoe (Hahaha)
Now you know
Yo, Slick, blow
It's drivin' me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move, you're dead)
That girl is (Poison)
(Poison, poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile
(Poison)
(Poison, poison)
She's dangerous
(Poison) Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Poison)
Yo, fellas, that was another dope one
You know what I'm sayin', Mike?
Yeah, B.B.D. in full effect
Yo, what's up to Ralph T and Johnny G
And I can't forget about my boy B. Brown
And the whole NE crew
Poison
