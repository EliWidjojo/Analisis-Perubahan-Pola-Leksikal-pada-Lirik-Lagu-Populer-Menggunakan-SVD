You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh-uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-huh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you, and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-huh
Huh, huh
Oh yeah, huh, huh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you, and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah, yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah, yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah, yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
