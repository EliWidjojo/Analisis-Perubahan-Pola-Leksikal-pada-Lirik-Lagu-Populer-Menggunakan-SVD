Come on, baby, let's, do the twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And go like this
Ee-yah, twist, baby, baby, twist
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist
My daddy is sleepin', and Mama ain't around
Yeah, Daddy's just sleepin', and Mama ain't around
We're gonna twist 'n' twist 'n' twist 'n'
'Til we tear the house down
Come on and twist, yeah, baby, twist
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist, ee-yah
Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist
Come on and twist, yeah, baby, twist
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist
Yeah, mess all 'round
Yeah, twist all night
Twist
