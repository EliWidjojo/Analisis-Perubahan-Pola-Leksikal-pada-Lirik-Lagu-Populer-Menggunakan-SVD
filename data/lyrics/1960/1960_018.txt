Uh-huh, honey
Alright
My baby whispers in my ear
Mmm, sweet nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else
Secret, baby, I keep 'em to myself
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
We walk along hand in hand
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Yeah, we both understand
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Sittin' in class a-tryin' to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Ah, sittin' on my front porch
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Well, do I love you? Of course
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Mama turned on the front porch light, sayin'
"Come in daughter, that's enough for tonight"
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Sweet nothin's
