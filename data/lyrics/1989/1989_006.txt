He's a cold-hearted snake (Girl)
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (Girl)
He don't play by rules (Oh-ho)
Uh-oh, girl, don't play the fool, no
You're the one givin' up the love anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off and runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?
He's a cold-hearted snake (Girl)
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (Girl)
He don't play by rules (Oh-ho)
Uh-oh, girl, don't play the fool, no
It was only late last night, he was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store, he's been trick-or-treatin'
When it comes to true love, girl, with him there's no one home
He's a cold-hearted snake (Girl)
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (Girl)
He don't play by rules (Oh-ho)
Uh-oh, girl, don't play the fool, no
You could find somebody better, girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better, girl
He's c-cold as ice
Cold as ice
He's cold as ice
He's cold as ice
Stay away from him, girl
C-c-c-cold-hearted, ooh-ah-ah
C-c-c-cold-hearted sss-snake
C-c-c-cold-hearted, ooh-ah-ah
C-c-c-cold-hearted sss-snake
He's a cold-hearted snake (Girl)
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play (Girl)

Uh-oh, girl, don't play the fool
(Ooh, ah) Look into his eyes
(Ooh, ah) He's been tellin' lies
(Ooh, ah) He don't play by rules
(Ooh, ah) Girl, don't play the fool
He's a cold-hearted snake (Girl)
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been tellin' lies
