So what are you doing back?
Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me
I really mean that much to you?
Girl, you know it's true
I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl? This love is true
You’re soft, silky hand, long, sweet, and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's aw-so-true
Together, we're one, separated, we're two
To make ya all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality in you that I admire
You're pretty, plain, and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl
And this is true
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
This is some certain thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear yo name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice was ringin' my ear
It stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotion, love, makin', enjoyin'
That's for me to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelin's I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearin'? I don't care how you fussin' before
The reason that I like you, girl, is for what you are
If I sit and think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl
I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl
And this is true
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
I'm in love with you, girl—
I'm in love with you, girl-girl-girl-girl—
