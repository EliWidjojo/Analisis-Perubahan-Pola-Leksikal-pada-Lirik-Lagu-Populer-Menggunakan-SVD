Sometimes it's hard
To make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here
I'll open my heart
And show you inside
My love has no pride I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes
And see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself
I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
Don't wanna lose you now or ever
Baby, I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever
We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay
It's all up to you
To tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that
I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever, never
But baby, I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me I'll be around forever
Forever, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna lose you
Lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose you
