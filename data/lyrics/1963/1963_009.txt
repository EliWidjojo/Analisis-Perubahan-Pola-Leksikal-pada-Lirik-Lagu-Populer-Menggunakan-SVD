He went away, and you hung around
And bothered me every night
And when I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice
My boyfriend's back, and you're gonna be in trouble
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
When you see him comin', better cut out on the double
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
You been spreadin' lies that I was untrue
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
So, look out now 'cause he's comin' after you
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Hey, he knows what you been tryin'
And he knows that you been lyin'
He's been gone for such a long time
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Now, he's back and things'll be fine
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
You're gonna be sorry you were ever born
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
'Cause he's kinda big, and he's awful strong
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Hey, he knows I wasn't cheatin'
Now, you're gonna get a beatin'
What made you think he'd believe all your lies?
Woah-ooh, woah-ooh
You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
Woah-ooh, wait and see
My boyfriend's back, he's gonna save my reputation
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
If I were you, I'd take a permanent vacation
(Hey-la, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Yeah, my boyfriend's back (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Well, look out now, my boyfriend's back (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Well, I can see him comin' (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
So, you better get a-runnin', alright now (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
My boyfriend's back now (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
I know he's comin' after you because he knows I was true now (La, hey-la, my boyfriend's back)
Yeah-yeah-yeah
