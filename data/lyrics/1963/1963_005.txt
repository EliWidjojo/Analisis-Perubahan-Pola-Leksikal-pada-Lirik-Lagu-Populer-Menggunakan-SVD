Blue velvet, woah-woah
She wore blue velvet (
Woah-woah
)
Bluer than velvet was the night (Woah-woah-woah)
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet (Woah-woah)
Bluer than velvet were her eyes (Woah-woah-woah)
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours, a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of
Blue velvet (
Woah-woah
)
But in my heart there'll always be (
Woah-woah-woah
)
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
She wore blue velvet (Woah-woah)
But in my heart there'll always be (Woah-woah-woah)
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
Blue velvet, oo-ooo-oooo-oooo
