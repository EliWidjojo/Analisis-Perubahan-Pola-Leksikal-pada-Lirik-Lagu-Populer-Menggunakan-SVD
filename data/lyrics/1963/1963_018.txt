Ooh
(Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Ooh
Walk like a man
Oh, how you tried to cut me down to size
Tellin' dirty lies to my friends
But my own father said, "Give her up, don't bother
The world isn't comin' to an end"
(He said)
"Walk like a man, talk like a man
Walk like a man my son
No woman's worth crawlin' on the earth
So walk like a man, my son"
Ooh
(Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Ooh
Bye bye baby, I don't-a mean maybe
Gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin'
Oh yeah, just look who's laughin' now
(I'm gonna)
Walk like a man, fast as I can
Walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world, "Forget about it, girl"
And walk like a man from you
Ooh (Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Ooh (Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Ooh (Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk)
