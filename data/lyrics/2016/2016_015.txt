I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was somethin' to do
I'm livin' out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin'
Stuck up on that stage singin'
All I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darlin', all I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with oldtimers 'cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
No, you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin'
Stuck up on that stage singin'
All I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darlin', all I know
Are sad songs, sad songs (
Hey
)
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
Well, my friends are all gone, but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown, yeah
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said, "Tell us how to make it 'cause we're gettin' real impatient"
So I looked 'em in the eye and said
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin'
Stuck up on that stage singin'
All that I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darlin', all that I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
