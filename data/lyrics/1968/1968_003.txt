See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So, it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed 'til I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show
And Honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car, and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And Honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now, all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights
And call her name
Now, my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
