When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Livin' without you is drivin' me crazy
I cry like a baby
Well, I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy or a puppet on a string
As I look back on a love so sweet now
I cry like a baby
Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby
I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy or a puppet on a string
Today we passed on a street
And you just walked on by
My heart just fell to my feet
And once again I began to cry
When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby (Cry like a baby)
Livin' without you is drivin' me crazy
I cry like a baby (Cry like a baby)
I know now that you're not a plaything
I cry like a baby (Just like a little bitty baby, now)
As I look back on a love so sweet now
I cry like a baby (Just like a little bitty baby, now)
Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby (Cry like a baby)
My heart just fell to my feet, you know
I cried like a baby (Cry like a baby)
You left the water runnin' now  (Cry like a baby)
I cried like a baby (Cry like a baby)
