The sound of your footsteps
Tellin' me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, babe
Brings out a need in me
That no one can hear except
In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you
But a little gold ring you wear on your hand
Makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
Staggerin' through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passin' so close beside you, babe
Sometimes the feelings
Are so hard to hide, but
In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you
There's a little gold ring you wear on your hand
That makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
In my midnight confession
When I'm tellin' the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
Na, na-na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, na, na, na, na-na
Na, na-na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, na, na, na, na-na
Na, na-na, na, na, na-na-na
