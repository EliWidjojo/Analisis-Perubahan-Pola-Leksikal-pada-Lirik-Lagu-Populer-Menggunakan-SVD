I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah
It was Harlem at the Ruckers (Yeah), I saw ya with your man (
Ooh
)
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand (
Ooh, yeah
)
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back (Mmm, mmm, yeah)
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that (
Oh yeah
)
So I skated off, as you strolled off (
Ooh
)
Lookin' at them legs, goddamn they looked so soft (
So fine, now
)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition (Woah, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts (Oh, oh)
And I be workin' out every day thinkin' 'bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view (Hey, yeah, yeah)
Catchin' flashbacks of our eye contact (Yeah)
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back (Ooh, yeah)
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears (
Baby
)
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years (Yeah, oh)
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush, yeah (Yeah)
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (Uh, check it)
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (This is more than a crush)
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (Yeah, yeah, oh, oh)
I see you at the bus stop waitin' every day (
Yeah
)
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way (Oh, oh, oh)
But I don't want to violate your relationship (
No
)
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip (Layin' back)
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream (Ooh, yeah)
Kissing on your thighs under moonlight (Mmm, mwah, mwah, mwah, yeah)
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality (I wonder, yeah)
Our love would come down so naturally (Comin' down, comin' down)
We would walk down the aisle of destiny (Ooh, yeah)
But your man get his hustle on, gotcha type scared (
Ooh
)
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair (Ooh)
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level, if you'll follow, I lead
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call (Standin' there, standin' there)
I had a vision it was me on the other end (Ooh, yeah)
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in (Come on by my way)
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands (Woah)
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor (Ooh, yeah)
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more (Mmhmm, yeah)
We experienced pleasure unparalleled (Oh, yeah)
Into an ocean of love, we both fell (Oh, oh)
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss (Ooh)
Undyin' passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but (Baby)
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true (
Yeah
)
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you (Ow, ooh)
So I'ma keep all these feelings inside (
Mmm
)
Keep my dreams alive until the right time (My baby)
