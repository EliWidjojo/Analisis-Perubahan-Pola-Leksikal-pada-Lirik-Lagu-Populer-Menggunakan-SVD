No matter what you think you've pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through
It's a given, L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm comin' after you
No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown
You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down
Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody walks into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you figured it's all right
Breakdown, take down
You're busted (Oh, oh, uh)
This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do
It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm comin' after you
Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody walks into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, honey
Just about the time you think that it's all right
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
Oh, busted
Oh oh
Shakedown (Breakdown), breakdown (Takedown), takedown
Everybody walks into the crowded light
Breakdown (Takedown), takedown (Shakedown)
You're busted (Busted, busted)
Shakedown (Breakdown), breakdown (Takedown), honey
Just about the time you think that it's all right
Breakdown (Takedown), takedown (Shakedown)
You're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody walks into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
(Let down your guard, honey)
Just about the time you figured it's all right
(Breakdown, takedown)
Oh, you're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody walks into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you figured it's all right...
