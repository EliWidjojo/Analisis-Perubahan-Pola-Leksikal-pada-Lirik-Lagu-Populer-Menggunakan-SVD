As I walk along, I wonder
A-what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on, I think of
The things we've done together
A-while our hearts were young
I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
I wonder, I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why, why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder a-where she will stay
My little runaway, a-run-run, run, run, runaway
I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
I wonder, I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why, why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder a-where she will stay
My little runaway, a-run-run, run, run, runaway
A-run-run, run, run, runaway
A-run-run, run, run, runaway
A-run-run, run, run, runaway...
