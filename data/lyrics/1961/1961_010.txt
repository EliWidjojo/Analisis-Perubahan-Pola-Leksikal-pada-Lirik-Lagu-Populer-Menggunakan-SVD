Can't you see I love you?
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cuz I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cuz I don't have a wooden heart
There are no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you know you should
'Cuz I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart
