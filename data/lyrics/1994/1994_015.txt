As you brush your shoes and stand before your mirror
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
And you walk the streets trying to remember
All those wild nights breeze through your mind
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking down on the streets
And the wind catches your feet
Sets you flying, crying
Ooh, ooh-wee
The wild night is calling
All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with wild wonder, yeah
And inside the jukebox roars just like thunder
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind, it catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Ooh, ooh-wee
The wild night is calling
Wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance, yeah
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the streets
And the wind, it catches your feet
Sends you flying, crying
Ooh, ooh-wee
Wild night is calling
Ooh, ooh-wee
The wild night is calling
