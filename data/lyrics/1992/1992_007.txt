Ooh, bop
No, you're never gonna get it (Ow!)
Never, ever gonna get it (No, not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it (My love)
Never, ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (Ow!)
Never, ever gonna get it (Not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it (My lovin')
Never, ever gonna get it
Ooh, bop
I remember how it used to be
You never was this nice, you can't fool me (Ooh, bop)
Now, you're talkin' like you made a change
The more you talk, the more things sound the same (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
What makes you think you can just walk back into her life (Ooh, oh, oh, oh)
Without a good fight, oh? (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
I'll just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself (Ooh, oh)
'Cause you're just wasting your time, oh
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin', yeah)
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)
Never, ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)
Never, ever gonna get it
Ooh, bop
Now, you promise me the moon and stars
Save your breath, you won't get very far (Ooh, bop)
Gave you many chances to make change
The only thing you changed was love to hate (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
It doesn't matter what you do or what you say (Ooh, oh, oh, oh)
She doesn't love you, no way (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
Maybe next time, you'll give your woman a little respect (Ooh, oh)
So you won't be hearing her say, "No way!"
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin', yeah)
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)
Never, ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change, oh)
Never, ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)
Never, ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)
Never, ever gonna get it (My lovin', yeah)
No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)
Never, ever gonna get it
Ooh, bop
Woo, yes, sir!
I give to the needy and not the greedy
Mm-hmm, that's right
'Cause you see, baby (Ooh, bop)
When you're lackin', you're losin'
And I'm out the door! (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
Doesn't matter what you do or what you say (Ooh, oh, oh, oh)
She don't love you, no way (Ah, ah, ah, ow)
Maybe next time, you'll give your woman a little respect (Ooh, oh)
So you won't be hearing her say, "No way!"
(And now, it's time for a breakdown)
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it
Woo-woo, woo, woo!
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never get it
