This next song is made popular
By incredible Jackson 5
And it's always been one of my favorite songs
And I hope it's yours
It's called, "I'll Be There"
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there (I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do (Ooh, ooh)
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)
Oh, woah, woah, oh
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you, yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well, it's all I'm after
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)
Yeah, yeah
I'll be there to protect you, yeah, baby
With an unselfish love that respects you (Ooh, ooh)
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)
No, no, no, oh, woah
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
You know I'm so glad I found you, baby (So glad, baby)
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength (Be your strength)
You know I'll keep holding on
If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby? Yeah, yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just call my name (I'll be there) and I'll be there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll be there, baby (I'll be there)
You know I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just call my name (I'll be there) and I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name, yeah
And I'll be there (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh) Mmm
Thank you
