Ahh
Ah-ha
Ahh
Ah-ha
You've got a cute way of talkin'
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers
And I'm walkin'
Like a dog hangin' on your lead
I'm in a spin you know (Ahh)
Shakin' on a string you know (Ahh)
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I feel like dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dance the night away (Yeah)
I feel like dancin' (Woo)
Dancin'
Ahh
Quarter to four in the mornin'
I ain't feelin' tired
No, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight
And leave on the light
'Cause I don't wanna go home
You put a spell on me (Ahh)
I'm right where you want me to be (Ahh)
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I feel like dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dance the night away (Yeah)
I feel like dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dancin' (Woo)
Dance the night away (Yeah)
Dancin'
Ahh
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do (Woo-oo)
Do do do do, do do do do (Ah-ha)
Do do do do, do do do do
And if you'll let me stay (Ahh)
We'll dance our lives away (Ahh)
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin' (I feel)
I wanna dance my life away (I feel)
You make me feel like dancin'
