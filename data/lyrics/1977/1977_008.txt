Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore
Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
Oh, I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again
Your love is liftin' me higher
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
Than I've ever been lifted before
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me, higher, higher)
So keep it up, quench my desire
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
And I'll be at your side forevermore
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me higher, higher)
Your love is liftin' me higher
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
Than I've ever been lifted before
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me, higher, higher)
So keep it up, quench my desire
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
And I'll be at your side forevermore
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me higher, higher)
Your love is liftin' me higher
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
Than I've ever been lifted before
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me, higher, higher)
So keep it up, quench my desire
(Your love keeps liftin' me, liftin' me, liftin' me)
And I'll be at your side forevermore
(Liftin' me, your love lifts me higher, higher)
