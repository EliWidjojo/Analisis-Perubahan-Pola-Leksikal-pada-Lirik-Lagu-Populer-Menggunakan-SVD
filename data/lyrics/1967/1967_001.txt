Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on, and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
I'll try
If you wanted the sky
Write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
"To Sir, with love"
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?
Oh, oh
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
