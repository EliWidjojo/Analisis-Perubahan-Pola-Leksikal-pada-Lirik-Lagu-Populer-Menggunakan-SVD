She asks him why
Why I'm a hairy guy
I'm hairy noon and nighty-night night
My hair is a fright
I'm hairy high and low
But don't ask me why
'Cause he don't know
It's not for lack of bread
Like the Grateful Dead
Darlin'
Gimme a head with hair
Long, beautiful hair
Shinin', gleamin'
Streamin', flaxen, waxen
Give me down to there
Shoulder length or longer (Hair!)
Here baby, there mama
Everywhere, daddy daddy
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Grow it, show it
Long as I can grow it, my hair
I let it fly in the breeze
And get caught in the trees
Give a home for the fleas in my hair
A home for the fleas
A hive for the buzzin' bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words
For the beauty, the splendor, the wonder of my hair
Grow it, show it
Long as I can grow it, my hair
I want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy
Snaggy, shaggy, ratsy, matsy
Oily, greasy, fleecy
Shining, gleaming, streaming
Flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, flowered, and confettied
Bangled, tangled, spangled, and spaghettied!
Oh say can you see
My eyes if you can
Then my hair's too short
Down to here
Down to there
Down to there?
Down to where?
It stops by itself
Don't never have to cut it 'cause it stops by itself
Oh give me a head with hair
Long, beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming
Streamin', flaxen, waxen
Won't you gimme it down to there? (Hair)
Shoulder length or longer (Hair!)
Here baby, there mama
Everywhere daddy daddy
Hair (Hair hair hair)
Grow it, show it
Long as I can grow it, my hair (Hair hair hair)
Grow it, show it
Long as I can grow it
My hair (Hair hair hair hair hair hair hair hair hair)
