What is a youth?
Impetuous fire;
What is a maid?
Ice and desire;
The world wags on
A rose will bloom
It then will fade;
So does a youth
So does a fairest maid;
Comes a time when one sweet smile
Has its season for awhile;
Then loves in love with me;
Some may think only to marry
Other will tease and tarry
Mine is the very best parry;
Cupid he rules us all
Caper the caper; sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along;
Sweeter than honey as bitter as gall
Love is the pasttime that will never pall
Sweeter than honey as bitter as gall;
Cupid he rules us all
Repeat:
A rose will bloom; it then will fade
So does a youth; so does the fairest maid
