Uh-huh-huh, oh yeah
Oh, listen to me, people
I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy (Buy)
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly (Fly)
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow (What makes a flower grow)
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow
(Too busy thinking about my baby) Oh, yeah
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Oh, yeah
Said, I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's going to last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class
Telling you I'm just a fellow (Just a fellow, yeah)
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time
(Too busy thinking about my baby) Oh, yeah
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Don't you know I'm too busy thinking 'bout my baby
Oh, and I ain't got time for nothing else
Oh, yeah (Hoo-hoo)
Oh, yeah (Hoo-hoo)
Yeah
Ooh
All the diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no, no (No, no)
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell you
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind (Oh, yeah)
And when it comes to thinking 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time
(Too busy thinking about my baby) Oh
And I ain't got time for nothing else
You know I'm too busy thinking 'bout my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Ooh (Too busy thinking about my baby)
(Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no) Oh, yeah
(Too busy thinking about my baby) Oh
(Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no) Yeah, she's never hard to find
(Too busy thinking about my baby) 'Cause she's always on my mind
