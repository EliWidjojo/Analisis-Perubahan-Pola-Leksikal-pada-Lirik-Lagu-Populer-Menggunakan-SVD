Oh, it's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me, to me
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see, i see
Oh, I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact, his eyes are as red as a sun
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yеah
And the man at the back said, "Everyonе attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
"It'll turn into a ballroom blitz"
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing is all I ever do, i do
Oh, I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you, of you
Now the man in the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye
Oh, yeah, it was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
'Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yesh
And the man at the back said, "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
"It'll turn into a ballroom blitz"
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the man at the back said, "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
"It'll turn into a ballroom blitz"
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
The ballroom blitz
Ooh, it's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
