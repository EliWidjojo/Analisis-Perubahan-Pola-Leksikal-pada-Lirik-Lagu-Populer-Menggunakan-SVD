The seats are fairly awake
Wait or send
Clothes are naked and I do not know
Unfortunately, we are very wealthy
We know that Christ died for all who have good intentions
I am with thy pong man
And I am in your grandson
Why not be negligent?
Am I shy?
Hey, why are you here
I do not know
Why can not I Phillip?
Bye, ahhh
It takes one minute for cooking
However, moisture required for muscle proteins
How did we have a salad? They are very aggressive
I know we missed every good customer
Then, closer to draw a cake
Why do you not hide me?
Why are you crazy?
Am I shy?
Hey! Why are you here?
I'm a little stupid
And why should we find the body not in the middle of F?
At the BBC (Oh)
I do not stoop
Check insurance
I do not mind, no
And not my shoes
I want a mouse
Go inside me
Oh Benny, why do you need to take care of me?
I miss my head easily
Why can not I, Phillip?
Golf, no
Hey, why are you here? (Pooh, yes)
I do not know
Why can not I Phillip?
Bye, ahhh
Hey, why are you here? (You shouldn't be here, just leave!)
I'm a little stupid
And why should we find the body in the middle of F?
Bye, ahhh
