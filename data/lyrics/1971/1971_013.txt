Wanted, young man single and free
Experience in love preferred
But will accept a young trainee, oh
Gonna put it in the want ads
I need a love that's true (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna put it in the want ads
My man and I are through (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
At home, I find myself lost and all alone
My man is playing the field, the thrill is gone
He stays out all night, says he's with the boys
But lipstick on his collar
Perfume on it too
Tells me he's been lying
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna put it in the want ads (Want ads)
This girl's in misery
Gonna put it in the want ads, ha
Somebody rescue me
I spend my nights alone, cryin' bitter tears
Although I cry aloud, nobody really hears
And when I need him most, he's never by my side
He's either playin' cards
Or drinkin' at the bar
He thinks that I'm a fool
I'm going to the evening news
Gonna put it in the want ads (Want ads)
I need somebody new
Gonna put it in the want ads, ha
My man and I are through
Extra, extra, read all about it
Wanted, young man single and free
Experience in love preferred
But will accept a young trainee, oh-oh, oh
Lipstick on his collar
Perfume on it too
Tells me he's been lying
I'm going to the evening news
Gonna put it in the want ads (Want ads)
I need somebody new (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna put it in the want ads, ha
My man and I are through (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna put it in the want ads (Want ads)
Ooh, this girl's in misery (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna put it in the want ads
Please somebody rescue me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna put it in the want ads (Want ads)
I need a love that's true (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
