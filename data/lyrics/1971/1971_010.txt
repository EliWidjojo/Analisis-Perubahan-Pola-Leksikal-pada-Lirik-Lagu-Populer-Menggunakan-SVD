Hey girl, whatcha doing down there
Dancin' alone every night while I live right above you?
I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me, you don't even know me, I love you
Oh, my darling, knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mmm-mmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness (*knock*, *knock*, *knock*)
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Woah-oh, twice on the pipe (*clang*, *clang*)
Means you ain't gonna show
If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart
Oh, my darling, knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mmm-mmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Woah, my sweetness (*knock*, *knock*, *knock*)
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Woah-oh, twice on the pipe (*clang*, *clang*)
Means you ain't gonna show
Woah, I can hear the music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me, you don't even know me, I love you
Oh, my darling, knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Woah-oh, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no (I love you, I love you, I love you)
Oh, my sweetness (*knock*, *knock*, *knock*)
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mmm-mmm, twice on the pipe (*clang*, *clang*)
Means you ain't gonna show
Oh, my darling, knock
