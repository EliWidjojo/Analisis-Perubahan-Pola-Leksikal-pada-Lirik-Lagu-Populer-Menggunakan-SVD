Little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jacky gon' be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey, Diane, let's run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please"
Say uh, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Say, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on
Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we oughta run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' a thing"
But Jacky say uh, "Oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"
Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
So let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon, make us women and men
Oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
A little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can
