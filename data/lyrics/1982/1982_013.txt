Cryin' on the corner
Waitin' in the rain
I swear I will never ever wait again
You gave me your word
But words for you are lies
Darlin' in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go, ho-ohh
But it's time to let you know...ho-ohhh
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feelin'
That never ever came
It feels so close
But always disappears
Darlin', in your wildest dreams
You never had a clue, hoo-oooo
But it's time you got the news
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
Darlin' in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know...ho-ohhh
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
I'ma gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'ma gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
No, oh, oh, oh
Harden my heart
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'ma gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart
Harden my heart
Swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow...
