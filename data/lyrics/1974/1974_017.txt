Ooh
Hey, did you rock and roll?
Rock on, ooh, my soul
Hey, did you boogie too? Did ya?
Hey, shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in you blue suede shoes
Hey, did you rock and roll? Rock on
And where do we go from here?
Which is a way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen
Jimmy Dean (James Dean)
And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen
Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean
Rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)
Rock on, rock on
(Hey, did you rock and roll?)...
